This program will look through a website and try to find certain predefined keywords. You'll need to put in a CloudFlare workers key and an OpenAI API key for this to work. It will save those keys to your local browser and gives you the ability to purge them from storage as well.

You can automatically search for sites once your API keys are configured by adding a query to the URL.

Example: https://joweber123.github.io/website-analyzer-sidekick/?domain=agency-website.com
